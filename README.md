## Data-Encryption-Standard-Algorithm
## DES Algorithm is a symmetric-key block cipher this is implemented in python3 language

#### Use the sample images for understanding the running process of DES Algorithm

#### The "des_encrypt.py" file is used to encrypt the plain-text using the key into encrypted text
#### The "des_decrypt.py" file is used to decrypt the encrypted text using the key into plain-text
#### The "DESboxes.py" file contains all the permutation, substitution, expansion, and compression boxes that are used in the DES Algorithm


#### Make sure that "DESboxes.py" files are present in the directory where "des_encrypt.py" and "des_decrypt.py" files are present. 

#### The plain-text should be 16 characters in hexa decimal format (_16 x 4 bits = 64 bits size_)
#### The key should be 16 characters in hexa decimal format (_16 x 4 bits = 64 bits size_)
#### The cipher-text / encrypted text should be 16 characters in hexa decimal format (_16 x 4 bits = 64 bits size_)
